Download the code base to get started with the Code Challenge and Short Answer Questions.

## The Problem
Your goal is to implement an interactive navigation bar that slides down and provides the user with sub-navigation options when the user clicks on a link in the main nav. You have already written the HTML and CSS for the navigation bar and the last step is to add functionality with JavaScript. You have been provided design mockups for the before and after states to work from.

## What to Code:

Write JavaScript in main.js to make the menu interactive.

When the user clicks on a navigation item, you will need to add a class to the link the user clicked on (hint: you can use the “active” class), slide down the secondary nav bar, and fade in the *related* sub-navigation section. If the user clicks on a link that is already active, all menu items will be unhighlighted and the secondary-nav bar will slide up.

You will not need to alter any HTML or CSS.
